## Home

Welcome to the documentation page of the first Twitch bot chat framework written in PHP !

## To resume

Twitch Bot framework is better than a casual bot. It is a real framework for developers who wants to develop their own plugins without need to parse twitch IRC !
It's simple, just follow the documentation ! 

## Download and source code

Source code and latest release is available on [Github](https://github.com/MyTheValentinus/twitch-bot)

## Feedback
If you use the bot or the framework, you can inform me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MyTheValentinus) or by Email (contact[@]valentin-deville.eu).

I'm glad to hear feedback from users !
